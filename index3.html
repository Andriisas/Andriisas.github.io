<h3 align="center">[Intro]<br>
You used to call me on my<br>
You used to, you used to<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You used to call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
Call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
And I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing<br>
I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you<br>
Got a reputation for yourself now<br>
Everybody knows and I feel left out<br>
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out<br>
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you<br>
Started wearing less and goin' out more<br>
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor<br>
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You used to call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
Call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing<br>
I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing</h3>
